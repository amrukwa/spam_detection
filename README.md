## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of spam detection model for e-mails.

## The dataset

The data used for training the model is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/spam-mails-dataset).

## The workflow

The complete workflow can be seen in the `workflow.ipynb`.

## To be done:

In the future, I plan on dockerizing this project, as well as build application in Flask for easier usage.
